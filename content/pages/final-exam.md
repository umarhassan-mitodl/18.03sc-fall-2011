Advice before trying the final exam:

First re-read the course introduction and each of the unit introductions for an overview. Next, look at the titles of each of the sessions to remind yourself in more detail what we have covered. Then, for each session read through the titles for each of the notes. A good review practice as you do this is to create and solve your own practice problems for each of these notes.

When you have reviewed the material and think that you are ready to take the exam, write the practice final and then check the solutions to see what you may need to review further.
